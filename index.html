				Hey there! My name is Richard Ortega-Amezcua, and I am currently an undergraduate student studying
				Computer Science Games at the University of Southern California. It always has been a dream to 
				create immersive and engaging content that people can enjoy just as much as I like creating them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here on this site you will find projects I have worked on over the past years.
