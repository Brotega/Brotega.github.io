				Hey there! I am currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science Games at the University 
				of Southern California. It always has been a dream to create immersive and engaging content that people 
				can enjoy, just as much as I like creating them. I'm driven by my curiosity to understand how modern games
				are created, so I enjoy learning as much as I can to implement new technologies... whether it involves 
				gameplay, graphics, or any other engine-related features.

				Here on this site you will find projects I have worked on throughout my programming career. Feel free
				to contact me at <a href="mailto:ortegaam@usc.edu">ortegaam@usc.edu</a> if you have any questions!
